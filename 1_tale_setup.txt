In a city called Vardhamana, lived a very efficient and prosperous merchant.

The king was aware of his abilities, and therefore made him the administrator of the kingdom. 
 
With his efficient and intelligent ways, he kept common man very happy, and at the same time he impressed the king on the other side. Such a person, who can keep everybody happy, is rarely found. 
 
Later, there came a time that the merchant's daughter was getting married. He arranged for a lavish reception. 
 
The merchant not only invited the king and the queen, who obliged by attending, but he also invited the entire royal household and all respected people of the kingdom. 
 
During the reception, he ensured to provide his guests with the best of treatments. He gave out magnificent gifts to guests to show them respect for attending to his invitation.
