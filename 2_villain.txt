A servant of the royal household, who used to sweep the palace, was not invited but attended the reception. 
 
He took a seat which was reserved for royal nobles, not meant for common invitees. 
 
This made the merchant very angry. He caught him by the neck and ordered his servants to have him thrown out to the merchants pet pig.
 
The royal servant felt very insulted, and could not sleep all night. He thought, "If I can have the king to disfavour this merchant, I will have my revenge. But what can I, a common fellow, do to harm a powerful person as him". Thinking such, he suddenly had a plan.
